				<description><![CDATA[In partnership with the James Cook University’s Centre for Tropical Water &Aquatic Ecosystem Research (TropWATER) the Cairns seagrass monitoring program was developed by Ports North in 2001 following a baseline assessment of the marine habitat within the port limits. Since 2001 seagrass at selected representative meadows has been monitored annually. An updated baseline survey of all seagrasses in the Cairns Harbour area was also conducted in 2012/13 as part of investigations for the Cairns Shipping Development Project EIS. Details of this program and reports can be viewed at http...]]></description>

				<name>Thursday Island</name>
				<description><![CDATA[Due to the high reliance on fishing in the Thursday Island area, habitats that support commercial and traditional fisheries, such as seagrasses, are of critical importance to the region. A fine-scale baseline survey of seagrass habitat conducted at the port in March 2002 identified seagrass as the dominant benthic habitat.  Since 2002, a biennial long-term seagrass monitoring program has been implemented to ensure that the ongoing health of the port’s marine environment can be monitored and maintained. The latest reports can be viewed at http....]]></description>

				<name>Karumba</name>
				<description><![CDATA[Since 2000, a long-term seagrass monitoring (LTSM) strategy has been developed in the Port of Karumba. The goals of the LTSM program are to ensure the protection of seagrass meadows in the Port of Karumba through minimisation of impacts of port activities on seagrass habitats and to periodically assess the health of Karumba’s port environment.  The LTSM reports can be viewed at https://research.jcu.edu.au/research/tropwater/resources/seagrass-port-surveys/karumba-port-seagrass-surveys]]></description>

				<name>Mourilyan Harbour</name>
				<description><![CDATA[Mourilyan Harbour is located 20 kilometres south of Innisfail and contains a port operated by Ports North. Mourilyan seagrass monitoring program was developed in 1994 following baseline assessments of the marine habitat within the port limits in 1993. Since 2000 seagrass has been monitored annually. The goals of the program have been to understand the general health of seagrass communities in Mourilyan Harbour,  to inform management agencies , and to help minimise potential impacts of activities within the harbour on seagrass habitats. Details or the program and reports can be viewed at http...]]></description>

				<name>Townsville Port</name>
				<description><![CDATA[The Port of Townsville is Queensland’s third largest multi-cargo port and is managed by Port of Townsville Limited (PoTL). Subsequent to baseline surveys, an annual monitoring program was developed in 2007 to understand the general health of seagrass communities in Cleveland Bay as influenced by either natural or anthropogenic causes. The results of this long-term monitoring will be used to assist in supporting management decisions for operational activities and planning port development. The monitoring also forms part of JCU’s broader statewide assessment of seagrass condition and an overall measure of the marine environmental health of Townsville and Cleveland Bay.]]></description>
