A fine-scale baseline survey of seagrass habitat conducted at the port in March 2002 identified seagrass as the dominant benthic habitat.  Since 2002, a biennial long-term seagrass monitoring program has been implemented to ensure that the ongoing health of the port’s marine environment can be monitored and maintained.

The results of this long-term monitoring will be used to assist in supporting management decisions for operational activities and planning port development.
